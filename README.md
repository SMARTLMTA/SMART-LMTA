# LMTA: Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Alerts for Incident Summarization and Mitigation Plan Generation

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of the LMTA (Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Alerts) methodology for enhancing Incident Summarization and Mitigation Plan Generation. The methodology integrates diverse data streams to generate accurate alerts, improving diagnostic effectiveness compared to traditional methods. The repository includes datasets and samples for training and testing LLMs models for Incident Summarization and Mitigation Plan Generation.

## Repository Structure

### Datasets
The repo contains two files: `Micross_LMTA.pkl` and `MSDS_LMTA.pkl` with mapped log, trace, metric, and alert data for the respective dataset. This is a sample dataset. entried dataset with code will be made available after acceptance of the paper.

- `Micross_LMTA.pkl`: Contains the PKL file for the Micross dataset.
- `MSDS_LMTA.pkl`: Contains the PKL file for the MSDS dataset.
